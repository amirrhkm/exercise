Learn to use git remote to push into multiple repo.

## Wednesday (6/3/24)
Learn and write the previous code into TypeScript and break the code into multiple functions which are readfiles(), compNum() and sumNum()
readfiles() will return array that contain all the lines from the file content
compNum() will return array that contain all the numbers extracted from each line, which this function read the char to char to get only digits from each lines and extract the first and last number and combine them into one.
sumNum() will return the value of sum by invoking the array from compNum(), which this function will calculate the sum of value in the array.
