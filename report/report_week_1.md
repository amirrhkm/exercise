# Report Week 1

## Task
    This week's main task involves a straightforward programming exercise. The goal is to create a program that reads text files, goes through each line in those files, extracts the first and last numbers from each line, combines them into a single value, and finally calculates the sum of these numbers from each line. The program is designed to handle text files with any number of lines, making it versatile for various scenarios.

## Friday (1/3/24)
    On Friday, I learned how to configure the GCC C compiler in the environment variables in order to execute .c files. After achieving success, the .c file can be compiled and executed using the PowerShell terminal. In addition, I have written the code for the primary task using the C programming language. Despite encountering multiple obstacles, I made the decision to write the code using Python and ultimately succeeded in accomplishing the primary objective. These activities serve as a review of prior information and syntax for writing various programming languages.

## Monday (4/3/24)
    On Monday, I acquired the knowledge of setting up the node environment in order to commence coding in nodejs. Upon completing the setup, I proceed to transform the primary task that I first wrote in Python into nodejs, which utilises a similar syntax to JavaScript. I have also acquired knowledge of version control system, specifically in the structure of the git environment, specifically about the processes of pushing and pulling repositories, establishing branches, developing on branches, merging branches, and understanding the benefits of using branches in team development.



## Tuesday (5/3/24)
    On Tuesday, I learned about ECMAScript 6 (ES6), an update to JavaScript that adds new capabilities and improves syntax. Then, I adopted enhanced ES6 syntax by modifying a few syntaxes from theÂ previous code. In addition, I learned about git remote, which makes it simpler to publish updates about our progress into several repositories.

## Wednesday (6/3/24)
    On Wednesday, I learned about TypeScript, a language that extends JavaScript, and how to configure the package using the npm registry. The above code is altered to divide it into many functions, readfiles(), compNum(), and sumNum(), each of which serves a distinct function. All of the lines from the file content will be included in the array that readfiles() returns. compNum() reads the char to char to extract just the digits from each line, extracts the beginning and final number, and combines them into one array that contains all the numbers taken from each line. By accessing the array from compNum() and computing the sum of the values therein, sumNum() will return the result of sum. I then execute the necessary .js file after transpiling the TypeScript into JavaScript. I also learn about unit testing, specifically on Jest framework, which makes it easy to construct test function. Then, I set up the Jest package from npm and make a test function for every code function. Upon successful, I also utilise Prettier and ESLint for TypeScript coding efficiency. Lastly, I included scripts in package.json to execute the tasks directly for efficiency as well.

## Thursday (7/3/24)
    On Thursday, I acquired the knowledge to set up the configuration file .gitlab-ci.yml in order to automate the execution of all the necessary commands for GitLab to handle the execution of the code. I am also acquiring the skill of generating code documentation by utilising the TypeDoc package.
